Hello! Welcome to the documentation of the handheld console in all of its development stages. Feel free to look through this page to discover how I went through the creation of a handheld console.

## The Idea

The main idea of the electronic project is to create an open sourced hardware using a Raspberry Pi; which is capable of running all sorts of different games. Making it an ideal microcontroller to implement what I want in a handheld gaming console. 

I wanted to make something that used all of the skills that were built in the TEJ3MR course including: soldering, 3D modeling and circuits. Creating a console creates a difficult yet entertaining project that will further strengthen my skills in engineering.

Hello! Welcome to the documentation of the handheld console in all of its development stages. Feel free to look through this page to discover how I went through the creation of a handheld console.

## The Idea

The main idea of the electronic project is to create an open sourced hardware using a Raspberry Pi; which is capable of running all sorts of different games. Making it an ideal operating system to implement what I want in a handheld gaming console. 

I wanted to make something that used all of the skills that were built in the TEJ3MR course including: soldering, 3D modeling and circuits. Creating a console creates a difficult yet entertaining project that will further strengthen my skills in engineering.

## Controllers

One of the core aspects of gaming is being able to control your movement in an easy way. In my handheld gaming console, I used a microcontroller (Arduino Pro Micro) to control the gamepad.

Esentially, when you click on a button from the gamepad, it sends a signal to the Arduino which then gives information to the Raspberry Pi to inplement whatever is clicked in real life. 

### Making the Gamepad

In the gamepad, I used a prefboard to attach the buttons by soldering them onto it. From there, the microcontroller is then soldered on the prefbaord to ensure signal is properly transferred from button to Arduino. 

Two different gamepads were made to ensure physical movement and camera movement could be possible when gaming on my handheld console.
